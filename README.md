Minesweeper
===========

I made this to learn how to use JavaFX. Took me the better part of a day to make. The cool thing is that as I kept working on it I only had to keep changing MSController to see gameplay changes. I don't know if that says separation of responsibility or monolithic classes, but I'm going to go with the former.

To run it, download and compile all the java files in src/sample/ and then execute Main.

You must have Java 8.
