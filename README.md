Minesweeper
===========

I made this to learn how to use JavaFX. Click to open a tile and right click to flag a tile. Supports clicking on opened tiles to open adjacent tiles if all the flags are present. Also supports arbitrary grid sizes and bomb counts but suffers a considerable performance hit past ~50x50 grid size. My guess is the tile opening algorithm.

To run it, download and compile all the java files in src/sample/ and then execute Main.

You must have Java 8.
